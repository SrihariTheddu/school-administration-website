  Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILOs) include the knowledge, skills and competencies embedded within every aspect of the college to inspire and enhance each student’s transferable learning skills.
  
  The ILOs represent the broad categories of competence that enable students to be successful in further education, careers, as citizens and in their personal lives.
  
  Social Responsibility Skills – Students will be prepared to practice community engagement that addresses environmental responsibility, social justice and cultural diversity.
  
  Critical Thinking Skills – Students will be able to gather and synthesize relevant information, evaluate alternatives and implement creative and effective solutions.
  
  Personal Responsibility Skills – Students will become independent learners who understand and express the lifelong skills necessary for physical, social, economic, mental and emotional health.
  
  Student achievement of ILOs is assessed within their programs, courses and co-curricular experiences. The results of those assessments are used to improve the learning experiences at GRCC. Visit Assessment of Student Learning to learn more.
